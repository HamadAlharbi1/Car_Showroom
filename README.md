# Car Showroom dashboard

Car Showroom Dashboard is a web application built with Flutter that provides a real-time view of a car showroom's operations. The dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales, inventory, and customer traffic, allowing the showroom manager to make data-driven decisions.
The main features of the Car Showroom Dashboard include:

Real-time KPIs: The dashboard displays real-time KPIs such as total sales, average sale price, and inventory levels. These KPIs can be filtered by date range, car model, and other parameters.

Customer insights: The application can track customer traffic and generate reports on customer demographics, preferences, and behavior. This data can be used to optimize marketing campaigns and improve customer experience.

Sales management: The application allows sales staff to manage leads, track sales activities, and view their performance metrics. The manager can also set sales targets and monitor the team's progress towards those targets.

Inventory management: The application tracks inventory levels, allows staff to add new cars to the inventory, and alerts the manager when inventory levels are low.

Overall, the Car Showroom Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the car showroom's operations and enables the manager to make data-driven decisions. The application is easy to use, customizable, and can be accessed from anywhere using a mobile device.
